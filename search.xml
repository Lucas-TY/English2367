After this, he invited me to go on a trip to Washington, D.C. with him, since I told him I didn’t have any plans for spring break.</p><p>Although the outbreak was just beginning, there were already some cases of infection in Washington. Many of my friends had cancelled their trips because of the outbreak. Although I knew going to Washington would be risky, I chose to go with Bruce because my roommate was home and my spring break would have been very boring if I didn’t hang out.</p>]]></content>

My resident parents are both Chinese, but they don’t speak Chinese.<br>They taught me how to prevent infection at the beginning of the epidemic, and taught me some Cantonese food and tai chi. Their Cantonese food is super delicious, I rarely get to eat these dishes in China!</p>]]></content>

It is extremely rare for an animal coronavirus to infect humans and spread through the population. You may recall the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003, which was a classic case of coronavirus transfer from animals to humans. More recently, another typical coronavirus strain, called MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), emerged in the Middle East in 2012, and scientists believe it was originally transferred from camels to humans.</p><h1 id="How-is-the-coronavirus-transmitted"><a href="#How-is-the-coronavirus-transmitted" class="headerlink" title="How is the coronavirus transmitted?"></a>How is the coronavirus transmitted?</h1><p>Between populations, the virus is usually transmitted through direct, close contact with an infected person. Touching an infected surface followed by touching the mouth, nose or eyes can also spread the virus, although this is not the main way the virus is transmitted.</p><h1 id="What-can-people-do-to-help-prevent-the-spread-of-the-virus"><a href="#What-can-people-do-to-help-prevent-the-spread-of-the-virus" class="headerlink" title="What can people do to help prevent the spread of the virus?"></a>What can people do to help prevent the spread of the virus?</h1><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="https://pic-lucas.tech/images/b67116a182c39b3e6f4237a2951af0a9.webp" alt="b67116a182c39b3e6f4237a2951af0a9.webp"><br><code>This is a picture I found from google, which depicts how Chinese people keep their distance in line in front of Apple stores.</code></p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that you maintain good hygiene practices, including washing your hands frequently, drinking plenty of water, covering your cough with your arm or a tissue, and staying home if you feel sick. Also, even if you are not sick, I recommend that you stay home; if you must go outside, keep a physical distance (at least 6 feet from others) and wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth.</p><h1 id="What-are-the-symptoms-of-the-new-coronavirus-COVID-19"><a href="#What-are-the-symptoms-of-the-new-coronavirus-COVID-19" class="headerlink" title="What are the symptoms of the new coronavirus (COVID-19)?"></a>What are the symptoms of the new coronavirus (COVID-19)?</h1><p>Symptoms of the novel coronavirus include</p><ul><li>Fever or chills</li><li>Headache</li><li>Cough, sore throat, stuffy or runny nose</li><li>Newly lost sense of taste or smell</li><li>Shortness or difficulty breathing</li><li>Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea</li><li>Fatigue or muscle or body aches</li></ul>]]></content>

Aside from wearing a mask more often and having to take classes during the middle of the night, the days seemed to be the same as before.</p>]]></content>
